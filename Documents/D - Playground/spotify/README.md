## My 2023 New Finds Playlist: Applying K-Means Clustering

### Welcome to my project! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

#### Throughout 2023, every month I decided to create an ongoing playlist to track every new song to me.
#### The onyl entry requirements were:
- Only add to this playlist if I really enjoy the song
- The song must be new to me, or at least re-discovered to the point that it feels like a new song

#### And voila! A dataset of 511 songs is now available to me, giving me the opportunity to explore the sounds of my 2023!


### There are 3 main parts to this project:
- playlist_download.ipynd: Read this to understand how I interacted with the Spotify API, which data I collected for each song, and how I organised this data
- EDA.ipynb: Read this to gain a better visual understanding into my dataset!
- ml_model.ipynb: The main part! Read this to see the execution of the k-means clustering algorythm, including pre-processing steps and post-model analysis and interpretation
